This is a new Cortex-M project created from STM32CubeIDE.
Its purpose is only to give the framework.
It does not use any resources, only starting the co-processor:


int main() {
	int i=0;

	for(i=0;i<100;i++);

	while(1);
}



To load it run :
./fw_cortex_m4.sh start


To stop it :
./fw_cortex_m4.sh stop


It can be enriched and debugged from the IDE ;-)
Have fun!
